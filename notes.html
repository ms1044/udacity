    <div><!--If I'm doing this right, this is my box for the first header and the first two paragraphs.-->
      <div><!--I may want to format my header differently than the following paragraphs.-->

      <div><!--This is my paragraphs box.-->

          HTML (Hypertext Markup Lanuage) is a reasonably straightforward language that helps computers take standard
          text and turn it into something more aesthetically appealing. It's assisted by CSS (Cascading Style Sheets),
          a script that can  quickly format many facets of your code.
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML works by using tags. Like any language, it seems to have a few quirks. Some tags, like <b>&lt;br&gt;</b>, operate
          alone to accomplish a formatting task (such as a line break). Other tags, like <b>&lt;p&gt;</b>, require a closing tag
          (such as <b>&lt;/p&gt;</b>) and format everything in between the tags accordingly.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div><!--This is my big ordered list box.-->
      <div><!--again, separating my header.-->
        <h3>A Variety of Options</h3>
      </div>
      <div><!--I'm putting my paragraph and list into one box, but also their own boxes in case I want to format them separately later.-->
        <div><!--The ordered list paragraph.-->
          <p>
            HTML also seems to have some built-in redundancy--something I hope to learn more about in the future. Some tasks can
            be accomplished using more than one tag:
          </p>
        </div>
        <div> <!--The ordered list itself.-->
          <ol>
            <li>
              The <b>&lt;br&gt;</b> tag breaks your text to the next line, but so does the <b>&lt;p&gt;</b> tag. It turns out the <b>&lt;p&gt;</b>
              actually creates a box of sorts, which we learned about later.
            </li>
            <li>
              The <b>&lt;i&gt;</b> tag <i>italicizes</i> your text, but the <b>&lt;em&gt;</b> tag does <em>the same thing.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
              The <b>&lt;b&gt;</b> tag <b>bolds</b> your text, but so does the <b>&lt;strong&gt;</b> tag. The material hinted at a difference
              between formatting text and emphasizing content. I would like to better understand this.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div><!--Big box for the takeaway paragraph.-->
      <div><!--Separating the header.-->
        <h3>The Big Lessson</h3>
        </div>
        <div><!--The paragraph itself.-->
          <p>
            My best takeaway for this lesson has been understanding the use of <b>&lt;div&gt;</b> tags. Imagine everything on your webpage broken into
            boxes, and then break each of those boxes into its own div. You can assign classes and id's to your divs, which helps the CSS identify which
            parts of your code to format. Once the important parts are <i>div</i>ided into boxes, presumably CSS can parse and format  those boxes in any
            number of ways.
          </p>
          <p>
            Spans seem to be just as important as divs, but I haven't immediately seen many uses for them. It seems that a span would be helpful
            if you wanted to have several inline tags in one block of text, but again--I don't see that happening very often. I'm certain they'll
            become more useful to me as I learn more.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div><!--Big box for the unordered list.-->
        <div><!--Separating the header.-->
          <h3>
            The Unordered List
          </h3>
        </div>
        <div><!--grouping my paragraph and list, but also boxing them separately.-->
          <div><!--The unordered list paragraph.-->
            <p>
              Finally, I wanted to mention a couple of the bread-and-butter tags.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div> <!--The unordered list itself.-->
            <ul>
              <li>
                The <b>&lt;a&gt;</b> tag is standard fare for linking to other places--such as my new <a href="https://udacity.com">favorite site</a>.
              </li>
              <li>
                The <b>&lt;img&gt;</b> tag imports pictures from some reachable source--and, of course, should exist in its own div.
              </li>
              <li>
                All the  tags I really know have already been used, but an unordered list really needs at least 3 points.
              </li>
            <ul>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    <div><!--Big box for the final paragraph-->
      <div><!--Separating the header.-->
        <h3>
          The End
        </h3>
      </div>
      <div><!--The final paragraph box.-->
        <p>
          That pretty much sums up my HTML knowledge at this point. I suck at notes, so I wrote an essay instead. My personal approach was to write
          out all the text in my editor, and place divs and such afterward. Hopefully that approach continues to work.
        </p>
        <p>
          So far, html seems like a tremendous amount of work to get my web page to look like a decent word document. I look forward to learning how
          CSS can shape it into something better!
